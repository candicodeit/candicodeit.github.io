# How I write my posts
There are two parts to my travel posts: the preparation and the experience. I typically don't like reading long posts. I skim for what I need. Like recipes, I skip to the recipe every time. Only every now and then do I read the in-between tips and such. I'm not here to make money for ads or gain the best SEO for my blog. Just sharing my experience. For now, I'll leave it as 2 separate posts. I could potentially split it into 3 but we'll just take baby steps.
