**About Me**

I'm Candi! I work in tech but I dream of traveling the world. I traveled more as a kid in Girl Scouts than I have as an adult. Hoping the change that over the next decade. When it comes to travel though, I like doing a TON of research. Collecting feedback from various friends and other fellow travelers. Maybe this can be a helpful resource for you! 

**About the Site**

Millennial is a minimalist Jekyll theme. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused publishing platform for your publication site or blog. You can find everything you need to get started under documentation. For more information on how to install and use this theme, check out [the documentation](https://lenpaul.github.io/Millennial/).
