Hello! I'm Candi. I've worked as a front end developer for 12+ years before transitioning into product management. As a kid, I was in Girl Scout, where we traveled more than just campgrounds. I went to Philadelphia, Hershey, Toronto, Baltimore, and DisneyWorld. In high school, we traveled for competitions, such as NYC and Myrtle Beach. Traveling as a kid was obviously easier. You help fundraise, have your parents sign the permission slips, and enjoy the trip! Now as an adult, it's not so easy. 

Naturally for my job despite my title, I'm always looking for ways to be more efficient. Always researching to make the best plans. Sometimes planning a vacation feels like a user research project. Find all the folks who've previously made that trip. Getting reviews on the things to do, places to see and eat, where to stay. Learn tips on what to bring. Figuring out logistics and learning any technology associated with the vacation, such as Genie+ or other apps. I'm hoping I can share my preparation to help some of you plan a great vacation!
